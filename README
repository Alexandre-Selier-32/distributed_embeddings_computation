This project performs distributed computing on AWS EMR using Spark.

While Spark makes it possible to do Big Data computing inaccessible on a
Personal Computer, here I am doing a Proof of Concept with a very small amount
of data, to keep costs low. But this Spark and AWS setup could easily scale up
to Big Data levels.

The computing I'm performing here is reduced embeddings for low-res fruit
images. That could be used for an image classifier.

The data consists of just 121 fruit images, belonging to 2 classes: Banana
Lady Finger and Apricot.

The complete setup includes an AWS S3 bucket and an EMR cluster comprising at
least 3 EC2 instances: one for the orchestration, 2 for distributed computing.
